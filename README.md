[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Jellycuts/in_app_purchase_receipt_verifier)

A simple, one-click deploy web app to simplify [the process of validating In-App Purchase receipts on the App Store](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ValidateRemotely.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH104-SW1). Written using Django 1.11 and Python 3.6.2.

## Usage

### Deployment

1. (Optional, but highly recommended) Download [IAPVerifierKeyGenerator.playground](meta/IAPVerifierKeyGenerator.playground) and run the playground. Copy the highlighted Base-64 encoded values below. Save these values for the next steps.

2. Create the project on [Heroku](https://heroku.com) using the Deploy Button above. Before you do, make sure that you've already obtained your app-specific shared secret for authentication from iTunes Connect. For the `BASE64_ENCODED_SIGNING_KEY` value, paste in the value for the private key from Step 1.

### In Your iOS App

1. Add `IAPReceiptVerifier` to your Podfile, then run `pod update`.

2. Use something like the following in your iOS app to validate your receipts.

    ```swift
    // Insert your Heroku app URL here.
    let url = URL(string: "https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/verify")!

    // The Base 64 Encoded public key from Step 1.
    let publicKey = "..."

    // Create the receipt verifier from the above values.
    guard let verifier = IAPReceiptVerifier(url: url, base64EncodedPublicKey: publicKey) else {
        return
    }

    // Check the app store to see if there is a valid receipt.
    verifier.verify { receipt in
        guard let receipt = receipt else {
            // Someone tampered with the payload!
            return
        }

        // Your application logic here.
    }
    ```

## Local Testing

```
curl -X POST -T receipt https://your-app.herokuapp.com/verify
```

...where `receipt` is a file with base-64 encoded receipt data.
